Lecture â€“ 42     Basics of subnet 

 

 

1) What is a subnet primarily composed of? 

a) A group of isolated computers 

b) A group of computers connected to each other via a single central device 

c) A group of computers connected to the internet 

d) A single computer with multiple users 

 

Answer: b) A group of computers connected to each other via a single central device. 

 

Explanation:  

a) = Subnet is not a group of isolated computers. 

b) = A subnet consists of computers connected to a central device like a router or a switch, facilitating internal communication within a network. 

c) = It is not correct. 

d) = It is not correct. 

 

 

2) What type of cable is most commonly used to connect computers in a subnet? 

a) USB cables 

b) HDMI cables 

c) Ethernet cables 

d) None of the above 

 

Answer: c) Ethernet cables 

 

Explanation:  

a) = Not USB cables. 

b) = It is not correct. 

c) = Ethernet cables are the most common method for connecting computers in a subnet, particularly in data centers and home networks. 

d) = It is not correct. 

 

 

3) What unique identifier does each computer use to communicate within a subnet? 

a) IP address 

b) MAC address 

c) Hostname 

d) Subnet mask 

 

Answer: b) MAC address 

 

Explanation:  

a) = It is not using IP address. 

b) = Within a subnet, the MAC address is used as the unique identifier for each computer to facilitate data transfer between them. 

c) = It is not using host name. 

d) = It is not using subnet mask. 

 

 

** 4) What role does the Wi-Fi router or switch play in a subnet? 

a) It assigns IP addresses to computers. 

b) It connects the subnet to the internet. 

c) It reads the data packets' source and destination MAC addresses and routes them accordingly. 

d) It provides wireless internet access only. 

 

Answer: c) It reads the data packets' source and destination MAC addresses and routes them accordingly. 

 

Explanation:  

a) = It is not correct. 

b) = It is not correct. 

c) = The Wi-Fi router or switch reads the MAC addresses in the data packets and routes the packets to the appropriate destination within the subnet. 

d) = It is not correct. 

 

 

5) What is NOT a characteristic of the MAC address in the context of a subnet? 

a) It is part of the hardware. 

b) It is unique to each NIC. 

c) It is assigned by the router. 

d) It is used to identify devices within a subnet. 

 

Answer: c) It is assigned by the router. 

 

Explanation:  

a) = It is a characteristic of MAC address. 

b) = It is a characteristic of MAC address. 

c) = The MAC address is embedded in the hardware and is unique to each Network Interface Card (NIC). It is not assigned by the router but is used by the router for internal communication. 

d) = It is a characteristic of MAC address. 

 

 

6) How is the network interface card (NIC) connected to a computer? 

a) Via USB port 

b) Via HDMI port 

c) It is embedded into the CPU 

d) Via the PCI slot on the motherboard 

 

Answer: d) Via the PCI slot on the motherboard 

 

Explanation:  

a) = Not via USB port. 

b) Not via HDMI port. 

c) = It is not embedded to CPU. 

d) = The NIC is connected to the computer through the PCI slot on the motherboard, enabling network connectivity.
